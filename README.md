# Uppercut

**An open-source, native video editor built for AI agents — and the humans who finish the job.**

Uppercut is a from-scratch, cross-platform video editor aimed at closing the gap between
free and workflows currently locked behind paywalled editors. It has two goals that
reinforce each other:

1. Every single edit operation is driven through one command API, so an AI agent (Claude
   Code, or any other model via MCP) can do the entire ideate → clip → order → caption →
   voiceover pass on its own, with a human doing final polish at the end.
2. The feature set — effects, transitions, filters, stickers, captions styles — is built
   by its community as plugins and asset packs, not gated behind a subscription.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or a clone of any existing commercial editor.

## Status

**Early / pre-alpha — Phase 3 complete (effects, transitions, packs, WASM plugins v1).**
CLI and MCP drive the full command API. Export renders video with burned-in captions,
mixed audio, speed/atempo, transitions, and effects. The Tauri desktop app (Windows)
provides the GUI; macOS/Linux CI builds the workspace (native preview still Windows-first).
Examples: [`examples/packs/starter`](examples/packs/starter),
[`examples/plugins/invert`](examples/plugins/invert),
[`examples/registry`](examples/registry). Manual QA: [docs/qa-checklist.md](docs/qa-checklist.md).

Read [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the full vision, tech stack rationale, and phased roadmap
before contributing or building on this.

## Why

Editing gameplay footage to a script in a paywalled editor works, but too many of the
features that make it fast — the ones that actually matter — sit behind a subscription.
Uppercut is an attempt to build the same caliber of editor as free, open, and automatable
software, so the tool decides nothing about what you're allowed to do.

## Architecture at a glance

```
uppercut-core/     headless Rust engine — project model, command API, media I/O, compositing.
                    No UI dependencies. The single source of truth every frontend calls into.
uppercut-cli/       thin CLI over the command API — scriptable, the simplest agent-drivable surface.
uppercut-mcp/       MCP server exposing the same commands + perception tools to AI agents. (Phase 1)
uppercut-app/       Tauri 2 desktop app; native GPU preview surface, webview for UI chrome only. (Phase 2)
```

One command API, one project schema, dispatched identically by the GUI, the CLI, and the
MCP server — see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full picture and
[docs/command-api.md](docs/command-api.md) / [docs/project-schema.md](docs/project-schema.md)
for the exact specs the code implements.

**Tech stack:** Rust engine (FFmpeg, wgpu, whisper.cpp for local captions, local/BYO-key TTS)
+ Tauri 2 UI, with the video preview rendered on a native GPU surface rather than through
the webview. Plugins are sandboxed WebAssembly; simple content ships as no-code asset packs.
Windows first, macOS/Linux to follow. AGPL-3.0.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 0** — done: schema, commands, CLI export spine (FFmpeg → wgpu → H.264).
- **Phase 1** — done: MCP server, Whisper captions, TTS voiceover, audio fades/ducking,
  perception tools (silence, scenes, peaks, frame render, transcript).
- **Phase 2** — done: Tauri GUI with timeline tools, native preview (Windows), audio scrub, export.
- **Phase 3 (current)** — effects, transitions, keyframes, WASM plugin SDK and asset pack format.
- **Phase 4** — community-driven feature parity march (background removal, motion tracking,
  templates, and more), mostly landing as plugins rather than core code.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd video-editor
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Try the CLI:

```sh
cargo run -p uppercut-cli -- new-project demo.uppercut.json --name "my-edit"
cargo run -p uppercut-cli -- apply demo.uppercut.json '{"command":"AddTrack","kind":"audio","name":"A1"}'
cargo run -p uppercut-cli -- show demo.uppercut.json
cargo run -p uppercut-cli -- export demo.uppercut.json out.mp4 --preset tiktok
```

Export requires `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on PATH (used as subprocesses in Phase 0; linked
`ffmpeg-the-third` is planned once vcpkg/FFMPEG_DIR is wired for all environments).

### MCP (AI agents)

```sh
cargo run -p uppercut-mcp
```

See [docs/mcp-agent-guide.md](docs/mcp-agent-guide.md) for tool list and a script-to-export workflow.
Set `UPPERCUT_WHISPER_MODEL` for auto-captions, `UPPERCUT_PIPER_MODEL` for local TTS, or
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI voiceover.

### Desktop app (Phase 2)

Requires Node.js 20+ and FFmpeg on PATH.

```sh
cd uppercut-app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

The webview UI dispatches all edits via `apply_command`; preview frames render on a native
wgpu surface (Windows only in v1).
